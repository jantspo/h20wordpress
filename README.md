Issues and Project assets
================================

- scrollspy -

    -clinking on any link for the first time when page loads does not apply proper offset. Subsequent clicks on any
    other links works fine.

    -links backgrounds light up as soon as section titles reach top of page, going both up and down the page, causing it
     to highlight the section above the current visible section when the current visible section moves down past the 0
     position of the top

    -when the bottom of the page is reached the highlighted link automatically switches to the last link. Working as
     intended, but because of the height of the previous section it never reaches the top before the bottom of the page
     comes into view, causing it to "skip" the second to last section.

     *** may be caused by conflicts with smoothscroll.js



- FARMitRX interactive section

    - still waiting for art assets and final decision regarding how the section should look/work
